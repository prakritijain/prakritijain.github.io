<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><em>All’s Well That Ends Well</em> was probably written later in Shakespeare’s career, between 1601 and 1608.</p>
<p>The five acts follow the action of Helena, a lowborn beauty, who pines for the son of her guardian, Count Bertram.
    She is granted his hand as a reward for curing the King, but Bertram runs away to war, declaring “When thou canst get
    the ring upon my finger which never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to, then
    call me husband.” Helena tricks him into giving her his family ring and sleeping with her, by posing as Diana, the
    virginal daughter of a widow. These were his conditions for being her true husband and he agrees to be a good husband
    in the final act.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s source is most likely a story in William Painter’s The Palace of Pleasure, which was in fact a
    translation of <a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/boccaccio/giovanni/b664d/dec34.html">the ninth story</a> from
    the third day of Boccaccio’s Decameron.</p>
