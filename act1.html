        <h4>Scene I. Rousillon. The Count’s palace.</h4>

        <p class="stage">Enter Bertram, the Countess of Rousillon, Helena, and Lafeu, all in black</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> And I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew: but I must attend his
            majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father: he that so
            generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose worthiness would stir it up where it
            wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> What hope is there of his majesty’s amendment?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose practises he hath persecuted
            time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> This young gentlewoman had a father — O, that ‘had’! how sad a passage ’tis! —
            whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so far, would have made nature immortal, and death
            should have play for lack of work. Would, for the king’s sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of the
            king’s disease.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> How called you the man you speak of, madam?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so:
            Gerard de Narbon.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and
            mourningly: he was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> A fistula, my lord.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I heard not of it before.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de
            Narbon?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes
            of her good that her education promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an
            unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity; they are virtues and traitors too; in her
            they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> ’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her
            father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this,
            Helena; go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than have it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the
            living.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Madam, I desire your holy wishes.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> How understand we that?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father<br>
            In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue<br>
            Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness<br>
            Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,<br>
            Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy<br>
            Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend<br>
            Under thy own life’s key: be cheque’d for silence,<br>
            But never tax’d for speech. What heaven more will,<br>
            That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,<br>
            Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;<br>
            ’Tis an unseason’d courtier; good my lord,<br>
            Advise him.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span>   He cannot want the best<br>
            That shall attend his love.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> <span class="stage">[To Helena]</span> The best wishes that can be forged in
            your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of your father.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exeunt Bertram and Lafeu</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> O, were that all! I think not on my father;<br>
            And these great tears grace his remembrance more<br>
            Than those I shed for him. What was he like?<br>
            I have forgot him: my imagination<br>
            Carries no favour in’t but Bertram’s.<br>
            I am undone: there is no living, none,<br>
            If Bertram be away. ’Twere all one<br>
            That I should love a bright particular star<br>
            And think to wed it, he is so above me:<br>
            In his bright radiance and collateral light<br>
            Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.<br>
            The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:<br>
            The hind that would be mated by the lion<br>
            Must die for love. ’Twas pretty, though plague,<br>
            To see him every hour; to sit and draw<br>
            His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,<br>
            In our heart’s table; heart too capable<br>
            Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:<br>
            But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy<br>
            Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Parolles</p>

        <p><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;<br>
            And yet I know him a notorious liar,<br>
            Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;<br>
            Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,<br>
            That they take place, when virtue’s steely bones<br>
            Look bleak i’ the cold wind: withal, full oft we see<br>
            Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Save you, fair queen!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> And you, monarch!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> No.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> And no.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Are you meditating on virginity?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me ask you a question. Man is
            enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Keep him out.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence yet is weak:
            unfold to us some warlike resistance.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> There is none: man, sitting down before you, will undermine you and blow you
            up.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up! Is there no military
            policy, how virgins might blow up men?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up: marry, in blowing
            him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
            preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first
            lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found; by being
            ever kept, it is ever lost: ’tis too cold a companion; away with ’t!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> I will stand for ’t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> There’s little can be said in ’t; ’tis against the rule of nature. To speak on
            the part of virginity, is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a
            virgin: virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
            offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies
            with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most
            inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose by’t: out with ’t! within ten year it will make
            itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the principal itself not much the worse: away with ’t!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it likes. ’Tis a commodity will
            lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with ’t while ’tis vendible; answer the time of
            request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just like the
            brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek;
            and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
            ’tis a withered pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet ’tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Not my virginity yet.<br>
            There shall your master have a thousand loves,<br>
            A mother and a mistress and a friend,<br>
            A phoenix, captain and an enemy,<br>
            A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,<br>
            A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;<br>
            His humble ambition, proud humility,<br>
            His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,<br>
            His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world<br>
            Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,<br>
            That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he —<br>
            I know not what he shall. God send him well!<br>
            The court’s a learning place, and he is one&nbsp;—</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> What one, i’ faith?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> That I wish well. ’Tis pity&nbsp;&nbsp;—</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> What’s pity?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> That wishing well had not a body in’t,<br>
            Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,<br>
            Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,<br>
            Might with effects of them follow our friends,<br>
            And show what we alone must think, which never<br>
            Return us thanks.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Page</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Page</span> Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I will think of thee at
            court.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Under Mars, I.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> I especially think, under Mars.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Why under Mars?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> The wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under Mars.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> When he was predominant.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> When he was retrograde, I think, rather.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Why think you so?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> You go so much backward when you fight.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> That’s for advantage.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> So is running away, when fear proposes the safety; but the composition that your
            valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return
            perfect courtier; in the which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier’s
            counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance
            makes thee away: farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends; get thee
            a good husband, and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,<br>
            Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky<br>
            Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull<br>
            Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.<br>
            What power is it which mounts my love so high,<br>
            That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?<br>
            The mightiest space in fortune nature brings<br>
            To join like likes and kiss like native things.<br>
            Impossible be strange attempts to those<br>
            That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose<br>
            What hath been cannot be: who ever strove<br>
            So show her merit, that did miss her love?<br>
            The king’s disease — my project may deceive me,<br>
            But my intents are fix’d and will not leave me.</p>

            For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend<br>
            Prejudicates the business and would seem<br>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,<br>
            Young Bertram.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span>   Youth, thou bear’st thy father’s face;<br>
            Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,<br>
            Hath well composed thee. Thy father’s moral parts<br>
            Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> My thanks and duty are your majesty’s.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> I would I had that corporal soundness now,<br>
            As when thy father and myself in friendship<br>
            First tried our soldiership! He did look far<br>
            Into the service of the time and was<br>
            Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;<br>
            But on us both did haggish age steal on<br>
            And wore us out of act. It much repairs me<br>
            To talk of your good father. In his youth<br>
            He had the wit which I can well observe<br>
            To-day in our young lords; but they may jest<br>
            Till their own scorn return to them unnoted<br>
            Ere they can hide their levity in honour;<br>
            So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness<br>
            Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,<br>
            His equal had awaked them, and his honour,<br>
            Clock to itself, knew the true minute when<br>
            Exception bid him speak, and at this time<br>
            His tongue obey’d his hand: who were below him<br>
            He used as creatures of another place<br>
            And bow’d his eminent top to their low ranks,<br>
            Making them proud of his humility,<br>
            In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man<br>
            Might be a copy to these younger times;<br>
            Which, follow’d well, would demonstrate them now<br>
            But goers backward.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> His good remembrance, sir,<br>
            Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;<br>
            So in approof lives not his epitaph<br>
            As in your royal speech.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Would I were with him! He would always say —<br>
            Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words<br>
            He scatter’d not in ears, but grafted them,<br>
            To grow there and to bear — ‘Let me not live,’—<br>
            This his good melancholy oft began,<br>
            On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,<br>
            When it was out — ‘Let me not live,’ quoth he,<br>
            ‘After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff<br>
            Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses<br>
            All but new things disdain; whose judgments are<br>
            Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies<br>
            Expire before their fashions.’ This he wish’d;<br>
            I after him do after him wish too,<br>

            I quickly were dissolved from my hive,<br>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> You are loved, sir:<br>
            They that least lend it you shall lack you first.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> I fill a place, I know’t. How long is’t, count,<br>
            Since the physician at your father’s died?<br>
            He was much famed.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span>   Some six months since, my lord.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> If he were living, I would try him yet.<br>
            Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out<br>
            With several applications; nature and sickness<br>
            Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;<br>

        <h4>Scene III. Rousillon. The Count’s palace.</h4>

        <p class="stage">Enter Countess, Steward, and Clown</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Steward</span> Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I wish might be found in the
            calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of
            ourselves we publish them.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah: the complaints I have heard
            of you I do not all believe: ’tis my slowness that I do not; for I know you lack not folly to commit them, and have
            ability enough to make such knaveries yours.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> ’Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Well, sir.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> No, madam, ’tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are damned:
            but, if I may have your ladyship’s good will to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Wilt thou needs be a beggar?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> I do beg your good will in this case.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> In what case?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> In Isbel’s case and mine own. Service is no heritage: and I think I shall never
            have the blessing of God till I have issue o’ my body; for they say barnes are blessings.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on by the flesh; and he must needs
            go that the devil drives.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Is this all your worship’s reason?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they are.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> May the world know them?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are; and,
            indeed, I do marry that I may repent.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> I am out o’ friends, madam; and I hope to have friends for my wife’s sake.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Such friends are thine enemies, knave.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> You’re shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that for me
            which I am aweary of. He that ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he’s
            my drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves
            my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men
            could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage; for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam
            the Papist, howsome’er their hearts are severed in religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl horns together,
            like any deer i’ the herd.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:</p>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>For I the ballad will repeat,</p>

            <p>Which men full true shall find;</p>

            <p>Your marriage comes by destiny,</p>

            <p>Your cuckoo sings by kind.</p>
        </div>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Get you gone, sir; I’ll talk with you more anon.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Steward</span> May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you: of her I am to
            speak.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen, I mean.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span>
        </p>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,</p>

            <p>Why the Grecians sacked Troy?</p>

            <p>Fond done, done fond,</p>

            <p>Was this King Priam’s joy?</p>

            <p>With that she sighed as she stood,</p>

            <p>With that she sighed as she stood,</p>

            <p>And gave this sentence then;</p>

            <p>Among nine bad if one be good,</p>

            <p>Among nine bad if one be good,</p>

            <p>There’s yet one good in ten.</p>
        </div>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying o’ the song: would God would
            serve the world so all the year! we’ld find no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a’!
            An we might have a good woman born but one every blazing star, or at an earthquake, ’twould mend the lottery well: a
            man may draw his heart out, ere a’ pluck one.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> You’ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> That man should be at woman’s command, and yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no
            puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going,
            forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Well, now.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Steward</span> I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and she herself, without other
            advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds: there is more owing her than is paid; and more shall
            be paid her than she’ll demand.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Steward</span> Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she wished me: alone she was,
            and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any
            stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son: Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference
            betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not extend his might, only where qualities were level; Dian no queen
            of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surprised, without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This
            she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e’er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I held my duty speedily to
            acquaint you withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> You have discharged this honestly; keep it to yourself: many likelihoods
            informed me of this before, which hung so tottering in the balance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,
            leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit Steward</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Helena</p>

        <p>Even so it was with me when I was young:<br>
            If ever we are nature’s, these are ours; this thorn<br>
            Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;<br>
            Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;<br>
            It is the show and seal of nature’s truth,<br>
            Where love’s strong passion is impress’d in youth:<br>
            By our remembrances of days foregone,<br>
            Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.<br>
            Her eye is sick on’t: I observe her now.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> What is your pleasure, madam?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> You know, Helen, I am a mother to you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Mine honourable mistress.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Nay, a mother:<br>
            Why not a mother? When I said ‘a mother,’<br>
            Methought you saw a serpent: what’s in ’mother,’<br>
            That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;<br>
            And put you in the catalogue of those<br>
            That were enwombed mine: ’tis often seen<br>
            Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds<br>
            A native slip to us from foreign seeds:<br>
            You ne’er oppress’d me with a mother’s groan,<br>
            Yet I express to you a mother’s care:<br>
            God’s mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood<br>
            To say I am thy mother? What’s the matter,<br>
            That this distemper’d messenger of wet,<br>
            The many-colour’d Iris, rounds thine eye?<br>
            Why? that you are my daughter?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> That I am not.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> I say, I am your mother.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Pardon, madam;<br>
            The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:<br>
            I am from humble, he from honour’d name;<br>
            No note upon my parents, his all noble:<br>
            My master, my dear lord he is; and I<br>
            His servant live, and will his vassal die:<br>
            He must not be my brother.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Nor I your mother?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> You are my mother, madam; would you were —<br>
            So that my lord your son were not my brother —<br>
            Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,<br>
            I care no more for than I do for heaven,<br>
            So I were not his sister. Can’t no other,<br>
            But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:<br>
            God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother<br>
            So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?<br>
            My fear hath catch’d your fondness: now I see<br>
            The mystery of your loneliness, and find<br>
            Your salt tears’ head: now to all sense ’tis gross<br>
            You love my son; invention is ashamed,<br>
            Against the proclamation of thy passion,<br>
            To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;<br>
            But tell me then, ’tis so; for, look thy cheeks<br>
            Confess it, th’ one to th’ other; and thine eyes<br>
            See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors<br>
            That in their kind they speak it: only sin<br>
            And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,<br>
            That truth should be suspected. Speak, is’t so?<br>
            If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;<br>
            If it be not, forswear’t: howe’er, I charge thee,<br>
            As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,<br>
            Tell me truly.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span>   Good madam, pardon me!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Do you love my son?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Your pardon, noble mistress!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Love you my son?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span>   Do not you love him, madam?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Go not about; my love hath in’t a bond,<br>
            Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose<br>
            The state of your affection; for your passions<br>
            Have to the full appeach’d.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Then, I confess,<br>
            Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,<br>
            That before you, and next unto high heaven,<br>
            I love your son.<br>
            My friends were poor, but honest; so’s my love:<br>
            Be not offended; for it hurts not him<br>
            That he is loved of me: I follow him not<br>
            By any token of presumptuous suit;<br>
            Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;<br>
            Yet never know how that desert should be.<br>
            I know I love in vain, strive against hope;<br>
            Yet in this captious and intenible sieve<br>
            I still pour in the waters of my love<br>
            And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,<br>
            Religious in mine error, I adore<br>
            The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,<br>
            But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,<br>
            Let not your hate encounter with my love<br>
            For loving where you do: but if yourself,<br>
            Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,<br>
            Did ever in so true a flame of liking<br>
            Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian<br>
            Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity<br>
            To her, whose state is such that cannot choose<br>
            But lend and give where she is sure to lose;<br>
            That seeks not to find that her search implies,<br>
            But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Had you not lately an intent — speak truly —<br>
            To go to Paris?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span>   Madam, I had.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Wherefore? tell true.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.<br>
            You know my father left me some prescriptions<br>
            Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading<br>
            And manifest experience had collected<br>
            For general sovereignty; and that he will’d me<br>
            In heedfull’st reservation to bestow them,<br>
            As notes whose faculties inclusive were<br>
            More than they were in note: amongst the rest,<br>
            There is a remedy, approved, set down,<br>
            To cure the desperate languishings whereof<br>
            The king is render’d lost.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> This was your motive<br>
            For Paris, was it? speak.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> My lord your son made me to think of this;<br>
            Else Paris and the medicine and the king<br>
            Had from the conversation of my thoughts<br>
            Haply been absent then.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> But think you, Helen,<br>
            If you should tender your supposed aid,<br>
            He would receive it? he and his physicians<br>
            Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,<br>
            They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit<br>
            A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,<br>
            Embowell’d of their doctrine, have left off<br>
            The danger to itself?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> There’s something in’t,<br>
            More than my father’s skill, which was the greatest<br>
            Of his profession, that his good receipt<br>
            Shall for my legacy be sanctified<br>
            By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour<br>
            But give me leave to try success, I’ld venture<br>
            The well-lost life of mine on his grace’s cure<br>
            By such a day and hour.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Dost thou believe’t?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Ay, madam, knowingly.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,<br>
            Means and attendants and my loving greetings<br>
            To those of mine in court: I’ll stay at home<br>
            And pray God’s blessing into thy attempt:<br>
            Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,<br>
            What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.</p>
