        <h4>Scene I. Florence. The Duke’s palace.</h4>

        <p><span class="stage">Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence attended; the two Frenchmen, with a troop of
soldiers.</span>
        </p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Duke</span> So that from point to point now have you heard<br>
            The fundamental reasons of this war,<br>
            Whose great decision hath much blood let forth<br>
            And more thirsts after.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> Holy seems the quarrel<br>
            Upon your grace’s part; black and fearful<br>
            On the opposer.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Duke</span> Therefore we marvel much our cousin France<br>
            Would in so just a business shut his bosom<br>
            Against our borrowing prayers.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Good my lord,<br>
            The reasons of our state I cannot yield,<br>
            But like a common and an outward man,<br>
            That the great figure of a council frames<br>
            By self-unable motion: therefore dare not<br>
            Say what I think of it, since I have found<br>
            Myself in my incertain grounds to fail<br>
            As often as I guess’d.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Duke</span> Be it his pleasure.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> But I am sure the younger of our nature,<br>
            That surfeit on their ease, will day by day<br>
            Come here for physic.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Duke</span> Welcome shall they be;<br>
            And all the honours that can fly from us<br>
            Shall on them settle. You know your places well;<br>
            When better fall, for your avails they fell:<br>
            To-morrow to the field.</p>

        <h4>Scene II. Rousillon. The Count’s palace.</h4>

        <p class="stage">Enter Countess and Clown</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> It hath happened all as I would have had it, save that he comes not along with
            her.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> By what observance, I pray you?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and sing; ask questions
            and sing; pick his teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.</p>

        <p class="stage">Opening a letter</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our old ling and our Isbels o’ the
            country are nothing like your old ling and your Isbels o’ the court: the brains of my Cupid’s knocked out, and I begin
            to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> What have we here?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> E’en that you have there.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> <span class="stage">[Reads]</span> I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath
            recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the ‘not’ eternal. You shall
            hear I am run away: know it before the report come. If there be breadth enough in the world, I will hold a long
            distance. My duty to you. Your unfortunate son, Bertram.</p>

        <p>This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.<br>
            To fly the favours of so good a king;<br>
            To pluck his indignation on thy head<br>
            By the misprising of a maid too virtuous<br>
            For the contempt of empire.</p>

        <p class="stage">Re-enter Clown</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> What is the matter?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your son will not be killed
            so soon as I thought he would.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Why should he be killed?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does: the danger is in standing
            to’t; that’s the loss of men, though it be the getting of children. Here they come will tell you more: for my part, I
            only hear your son was run away.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Helena, and two Gentlemen</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Gentleman</span> Save you, good madam.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Gentleman</span> Do not say so.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,<br>
            I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,<br>
            That the first face of neither, on the start,<br>
            Can woman me unto’t: where is my son, I pray you?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Gentleman</span> Madam, he’s gone to serve the duke of Florence:<br>
            We met him thitherward; for thence we came,<br>
            And, after some dispatch in hand at court,<br>
            Thither we bend again.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Look on his letter, madam; here’s my passport.</p>

        <p><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which never shall come off, and show
            me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to, then call me husband: but in such a ‘then’ I write a ‘never.’</p>

        <p>This is a dreadful sentence.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Brought you this letter, gentlemen?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Gentleman</span> Ay, madam;<br>
            And for the contents’ sake are sorry for our pain.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;<br>
            If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,<br>
            Thou robb’st me of a moiety: he was my son;<br>
            But I do wash his name out of my blood,<br>
            And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Gentleman</span> Ay, madam.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span>   And to be a soldier?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Gentleman</span> Such is his noble purpose; and believe ’t,<br>
            The duke will lay upon him all the honour<br>
            That good convenience claims.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Return you thither?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Gentleman</span> Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> <span class="stage">[Reads]</span> Till I have no wife I have nothing in
            France.<br>
            ’Tis bitter.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span>   Find you that there?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Ay, madam.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Gentleman</span> ’Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his heart was not
            consenting to.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Nothing in France, until he have no wife!<br>
            There’s nothing here that is too good for him<br>
            But only she; and she deserves a lord<br>
            That twenty such rude boys might tend upon<br>
            And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Gentleman</span> A servant only, and a gentleman<br>
            Which I have sometime known.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Parolles, was it not?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Gentleman</span> Ay, my good lady, he.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.<br>
            My son corrupts a well-derived nature<br>
            With his inducement.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Gentleman</span> Indeed, good lady,<br>
            The fellow has a deal of that too much,<br>
            Which holds him much to have.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> You’re welcome, gentlemen.<br>
            I will entreat you, when you see my son,<br>
            To tell him that his sword can never win<br>
            The honour that he loses: more I’ll entreat you<br>
            Written to bear along.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Gentleman</span> We serve you, madam,<br>
            In that and all your worthiest affairs.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Not so, but as we change our courtesies.<br>
            Will you draw near!</p>

        <p class="stage">Exeunt Countess and Gentlemen</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> ‘Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.’<br>
            Nothing in France, until he has no wife!<br>
            Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;<br>
            Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is’t I<br>
            That chase thee from thy country and expose<br>
            Those tender limbs of thine to the event<br>
            Of the none-sparing war? and is it I<br>
            That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou<br>
            Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark<br>
            Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,<br>
            That ride upon the violent speed of fire,<br>
            Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,<br>
            That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.<br>
            Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;<br>
            Whoever charges on his forward breast,<br>
            I am the caitiff that do hold him to’t;<br>
            And, though I kill him not, I am the cause<br>
            His death was so effected: better ’twere<br>
            I met the ravin lion when he roar’d<br>
            With sharp constraint of hunger; better ’twere<br>
            That all the miseries which nature owes<br>
            Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>
            Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,<br>
            As oft it loses all: I will be gone;<br>
            My being here it is that holds thee hence:<br>
            Shall I stay here to do’t? no, no, although<br>
            The air of paradise did fan the house<br>
            And angels officed all: I will be gone,<br>
            That pitiful rumour may report my flight,<br>
            To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!<br>
            For with the dark, poor thief, I’ll steal away.</p>

            that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they are limed

        <p><span class="speaker">Widow</span> Here you shall see a countryman of yours<br>
            That has done worthy service.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> His name, I pray you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:<br>
            His face I know not.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> Whatsome’er he is,<br>
            He’s bravely taken here. He stole from France,<br>
            As ’tis reported, for the king had married him<br>
            Against his liking: think you it is so?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> There is a gentleman that serves the count<br>
            Reports but coarsely of her.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> What’s his name?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> Monsieur Parolles.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span>   O, I believe with him,<br>
            In argument of praise, or to the worth<br>
            Of the great count himself, she is too mean<br>
            To have her name repeated: all her deserving<br>
            Is a reserved honesty, and that<br>
            I have not heard examined.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> Alas, poor lady!<br>
            ’Tis a hard bondage to become the wife<br>
            Of a detesting lord.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Widow</span> I warrant, good creature, wheresoe’er she is,<br>
            Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her<br>
            A shrewd turn, if she pleased.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> How do you mean?<br>
            May be the amorous count solicits her<br>
            In the unlawful purpose.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Widow</span> He does indeed;<br>
            And brokes with all that can in such a suit<br>
            Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:<br>
            But she is arm’d for him and keeps her guard<br>
            In honestest defence.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Mariana</span> The gods forbid else!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Widow</span> So, now they come:</p>

        <p class="stage">Drum and Colours</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Bertram, Parolles, and the whole army</p>

        <p>That is Antonio, the duke’s eldest son;<br>
            That, Escalus.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span>   Which is the Frenchman?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> He;<br>
            That with the plume: ’tis a most gallant fellow.<br>
            I would he loved his wife: if he were honester<br>
            He were much goodlier: is’t not a handsome gentleman?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> I like him well.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> ’Tis pity he is not honest: yond’s that same knave<br>
            That leads him to these places: were I his lady,<br>
            I would Poison that vile rascal.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Which is he?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Perchance he’s hurt i’ the battle.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Lose our drum! well.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Mariana</span> He’s shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Widow</span> Marry, hang you!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Mariana</span> And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!</p>

        <p class="stage">Exeunt Bertram, Parolles, and army</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Widow</span> The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you<br>
            Where you shall host: of enjoin’d penitents<br>
            There’s four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,<br>
            Already at my house.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> I humbly thank you:<br>
            Please it this matron and this gentle maid<br>
            To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking<br>
            Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,<br>
            I will bestow some precepts of this virgin<br>
            Worthy the note.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Both</span>   We’ll take your offer kindly.</p>

        <h4>Scene VI. Camp before Florence.</h4>

        <p class="stage">Enter Bertram and the two French Lords</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Nay, good my lord, put him to’t; let him have his way.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your
            respect.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> On my life, my lord, a bubble.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Do you think I am so far deceived in him?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but
            to speak of him as my kinsman, he’s a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the
            owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship’s entertainment.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he
            hath not, he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I would I knew in what particular action to try him.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so
            confidently undertake to do.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly surprise him; such I will
            have, whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink him so, that he shall suppose no other but
            that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship
            present at his examination: if he do not, for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer
            to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul
            upon oath, never trust my judgment in any thing.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he says he has a
            stratagem for’t: when your lordship sees the bottom of his success in’t, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore
            will be melted, if you give him not John Drum’s entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Parolles</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> <span class="stage">[Aside to Bertram]</span> O, for the love of laughter,
            hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch off his drum in any hand.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your disposition.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> A pox on’t, let it go; ’tis but a drum.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> ‘But a drum’! is’t ‘but a drum’? A drum so lost! There was excellent command —
            to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> That was not to be blamed in the command of the service: it was a disaster
            of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had been there to command.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in the loss
            of that drum; but it is not to be recovered.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> It might have been recovered.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> It might; but it is not now.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> It is to be recovered: but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to
            the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or another, or ’hic jacet.’</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Why, if you have a stomach, to’t, monsieur: if you think your mystery in
            stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go
            on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it. and extend
            to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> But you must not now slumber in it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I’ll about it this evening: and I will presently pen down my dilemmas,
            encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further from
            me.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I know not what the success will be, my lord; but the attempt I vow.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I know thou’rt valiant; and, to the possibility of thy soldiership, will
            subscribe for thee. Farewell.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I love not many words.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange fellow, my lord,
            that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do and dares
            better be damned than to do’t?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it is that he will steal
            himself into a man’s favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out, you have him
            ever after.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does
            address himself unto?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> None in the world; but return with an invention and clap upon you two or
            three probable lies: but we have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is not for your
            lordship’s respect.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> We’ll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. He was first smoked
            by the old lord Lafeu: when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you shall see
            this very night.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Your brother he shall go along with me.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> As’t please your lordship: I’ll leave you.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Now will I lead you to the house, and show you<br>
            The lass I spoke of.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> But you say she’s honest.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> That’s all the fault: I spoke with her but once<br>
            And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,<br>
            By this same coxcomb that we have i’ the wind,<br>
            Tokens and letters which she did re-send;<br>
            And this is all I have done. She’s a fair creature:<br>
            Will you go see her?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> With all my heart, my lord.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Helena and Widow</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> If you misdoubt me that I am not she,<br>
            I know not how I shall assure you further,<br>
            But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Widow</span> Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,<br>
            Nothing acquainted with these businesses;<br>
            And would not put my reputation now<br>
            In any staining act.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Nor would I wish you.<br>
            First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,<br>
            And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken<br>
            Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,<br>
            By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,<br>
            Err in bestowing it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Widow</span> I should believe you:<br>
            For you have show’d me that which well approves<br>
            You’re great in fortune.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Take this purse of gold,<br>
            And let me buy your friendly help thus far,<br>
            Which I will over-pay and pay again<br>
            When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,<br>
            Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,<br>
            Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,<br>
            As we’ll direct her how ’tis best to bear it.<br>
            Now his important blood will nought deny<br>
            That she’ll demand: a ring the county wears,<br>
            That downward hath succeeded in his house<br>
            From son to son, some four or five descents<br>
            Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds<br>
            In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,<br>
            To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,<br>
            Howe’er repented after.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Widow</span> Now I see<br>
            The bottom of your purpose.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> You see it lawful, then: it is no more,<br>

            In fine, delivers me to fill the time,<br>
            Herself most chastely absent: after this,<br>
            To marry her, I’ll add three thousand crowns<br>
            To what is passed already.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Widow</span> I have yielded:<br>
            Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,<br>
            That time and place with this deceit so lawful<br>
            May prove coherent. Every night he comes<br>
            With musics of all sorts and songs composed<br>
            To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us<br>
            To chide him from our eaves; for he persists<br>
            As if his life lay on’t.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Why then to-night<br>
            Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,<br>
            Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed<br>
