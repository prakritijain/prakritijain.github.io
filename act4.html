        <h4>Scene I. Without the Florentine camp.</h4>

        <p class="stage">Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner. When you sally upon him,
            speak what terrible language you will: though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to
            understand him, unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> Good captain, let me be the interpreter.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> No, sir, I warrant you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> E’en such as you speak to me.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> He must think us some band of strangers i’ the adversary’s entertainment.
            Now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know
            what we speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs’ language, gabble enough,
            and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes, to beguile two
            hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Parolles</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Ten o’clock: within these three hours ’twill be time enough to go home. What
            shall I say I have done? It must be a very plausive invention that carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces
            have of late knocked too often at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of Mars before
            it and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my tongue.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> This is the first truth that e’er thine own tongue was guilty of.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum, being
            not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and say I got them
            in exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they will say, ‘Came you off with so little?’ and great ones I dare not
            give. Wherefore, what’s the instance? Tongue, I must put you into a butter-woman’s mouth and buy myself another of
            Bajazet’s mule, if you prattle me into these perils.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the breaking of my
            Spanish sword.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> We cannot afford you so.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in stratagem.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> ’Twould not do.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Hardly serve.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> How deep?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Thirty fathom.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I would I had any drum of the enemy’s: I would swear I recovered it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> You shall hear one anon.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> A drum now of the enemy’s&nbsp; —</p>

        <p class="stage">Alarum within</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">All</span> Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.</p>

        <p class="stage">They seize and blindfold him</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> Boskos thromuldo boskos.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I know you are the Muskos’ regiment:<br>
            And I shall lose my life for want of language;<br>
            If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,<br>
            Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I’ll<br>
            Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak thy tongue. Kerely
            bonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> O!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Oscorbidulchos volivorco.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> The general is content to spare thee yet;<br>
            And, hoodwink’d as thou art, will lead thee on<br>
            To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform<br>
            Something to save thy life.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> O, let me live!<br>
            And all the secrets of our camp I’ll show,<br>
            Their force, their purposes; nay, I’ll speak that<br>
            Which you will wonder at.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> But wilt thou faithfully?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> If I do not, damn me.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> Acordo linta.<br>
            Come on; thou art granted space.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit, with Parolles guarded. A short alarum within</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother,<br>
            We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled<br>
            Till we do hear from them.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Soldier</span> Captain, I will.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> A’ will betray us all unto ourselves:<br>
            Inform on that.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Soldier</span>   So I will, sir.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Till then I’ll keep him dark and safely lock’d.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exeunt</p>

        <h4>Scene II. Florence. The Widow’s house.</h4>

        <p class="stage">Enter Bertram and Diana</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> They told me that your name was Fontibell.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> No, my good lord, Diana.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Titled goddess;<br>
            And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,<br>
            In your fine frame hath love no quality?<br>
            If quick fire of youth light not your mind,<br>
            You are no maiden, but a monument:<br>
            When you are dead, you should be such a one<br>
            As you are now, for you are cold and stem;<br>
            And now you should be as your mother was<br>
            When your sweet self was got.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> She then was honest.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> So should you be.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> No:<br>
            My mother did but duty; such, my lord,<br>
            As you owe to your wife.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> No more o’ that;<br>
            I prithee, do not strive against my vows:<br>
            I was compell’d to her; but I love thee<br>
            By love’s own sweet constraint, and will for ever<br>
            Do thee all rights of service.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> Ay, so you serve us<br>
            Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,<br>
            You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves<br>
            And mock us with our bareness.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> How have I sworn!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> ’Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,<br>
            But the plain single vow that is vow’d true.<br>
            What is not holy, that we swear not by,<br>
            But take the High’st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,<br>
            If I should swear by God’s great attributes,<br>
            I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,<br>
            When I did love you ill? This has no holding,<br>
            To swear by him whom I protest to love,<br>
            That I will work against him: therefore your oaths<br>
            Are words and poor conditions, but unseal’d,<br>
            At least in my opinion.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Change it, change it;<br>
            Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;<br>
            And my integrity ne’er knew the crafts<br>
            That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,<br>
            But give thyself unto my sick desires,<br>
            Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever<br>
            My love as it begins shall so persever.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> I see that men make ropes in such a scarre<br>
            That we’ll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I’ll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power<br>
            To give it from me.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> Will you not, my lord?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> It is an honour ’longing to our house,<br>
            Bequeathed down from many ancestors;<br>
            Which were the greatest obloquy i’ the world<br>
            In me to lose.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span>   Mine honour’s such a ring:<br>
            My chastity’s the jewel of our house,<br>
            Bequeathed down from many ancestors;<br>
            Which were the greatest obloquy i’ the world<br>
            In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom<br>
            Brings in the champion Honour on my part,<br>
            Against your vain assault.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Here, take my ring:<br>
            My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,<br>
            And I’ll be bid by thee.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:<br>
            I’ll order take my mother shall not hear.<br>
            Now will I charge you in the band of truth,<br>
            When you have conquer’d my yet maiden bed,<br>
            Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:<br>
            My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them<br>
            When back again this ring shall be deliver’d:<br>
            And on your finger in the night I’ll put<br>
            Another ring, that what in time proceeds<br>
            May token to the future our past deeds.<br>
            Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won<br>
            A wife of me, though there my hope be done.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> For which live long to thank both heaven and me!<br>
            You may so in the end.<br>
            My mother told me just how he would woo,<br>
            As if she sat in ’s heart; she says all men<br>
            Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me<br>
            When his wife’s dead; therefore I’ll lie with him<br>
            When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,<br>
            Marry that will, I live and die a maid:<br>
            Only in this disguise I think’t no sin<br>
            To cozen him that would unjustly win.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>
    </div>

    <div id="act4.3" title="SCENE III. The Florentine camp.">
        <h4>Scene III. The Florentine camp.</h4>

        <p class="stage">Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> You have not given him his mother’s letter?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> I have delivered it an hour since: there is something in’t that stings his
            nature; for on the reading it he changed almost into another man.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so
            sweet a lady.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king, who
            had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with
            you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> When you have spoken it, ’tis dead, and I am the grave of it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most chaste
            renown; and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath given her his monumental ring, and
            thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves, what things are we!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of all treasons, we
            still see them reveal themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends, so he that in this action contrives against
            his own nobility, in his proper stream o’erflows himself.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? We
            shall not then have his company to-night?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see his company anatomized,
            that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> We will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the whip
            of the other.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> I hear there is an overture of peace.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel higher, or return again
            into France?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether of his council.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal of his act.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house: her pretence is a
            pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished; and, there
            residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now
            she sings in heaven.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> How is this justified?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> The stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true, even
            to the point of her death: her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
            the rector of the place.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Hath the count all this intelligence?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, so to the full
            arming of the verity.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> I am heartily sorry that he’ll be glad of this.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! The great
            dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together: our virtues
            would be proud, if our faults whipped them not; and our crimes would despair, if they were not cherished by our
            virtues.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter a Messenger</p>

        <p>How now! where’s your master?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Servant</span> He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath taken a solemn leave: his
            lordship will next morning for France. The duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> They shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can
            commend.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> They cannot be too sweet for the king’s tartness. Here’s his lordship
            now.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Bertram</p>

        <p>How now, my lord! is’t not after midnight?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a month’s length a-piece, by an
            abstract of success: I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ
            to my lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer
            needs; the last was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> If the business be of any difficulty, and this morning your departure
            hence, it requires haste of your lordship.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter. But
            shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module, he has
            deceived me, like a double-meaning prophesier.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Bring him forth: has sat i’ the stocks all night, poor gallant knave.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping his spurs so long. How does
            he carry himself?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry him. But to answer you
            as you would be understood; he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he
            supposes to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i’ the stocks:
            and what think you he hath confessed?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Nothing of me, has a’?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face: if your lordship
            be in’t, as I believe you are, you must have the patience to hear it.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Parolles guarded, and First Soldier</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me: hush, hush!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> He calls for the tortures: what will you say without ’em?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I will confess what I know without constraint: if ye pinch me like a pasty, I
            can say no more.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> Bosko chimurcho.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> Boblibindo chicurmurco.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> You are a merciful general. Our general bids you answer to what I shall
            ask you out of a note.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> And truly, as I hope to live.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> <span class="stage">[Reads]</span> ‘First demand of him how many horse
            the duke is strong.’ What say you to that?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable: the troops are all
            scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation and credit and as I hope to live.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> Shall I set down your answer so?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Do: I’ll take the sacrament on’t, how and which way you will.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> All’s one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> You’re deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant militarist
            — that was his own phrase — that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape
            of his dagger.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean. nor believe he
            can have every thing in him by wearing his apparel neatly.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> Well, that’s set down.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Five or six thousand horse, I said — I will say true — or thereabouts, set
            down, for I’ll speak truth.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> He’s very near the truth in this.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> But I con him no thanks for’t, in the nature he delivers it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Poor rogues, I pray you, say.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> Well, that’s set down.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I humbly thank you, sir: a truth’s a truth, the rogues are marvellous
            poor.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> <span class="stage">[Reads]</span> ‘Demand of him, of what strength they
            are a-foot.’ What say you to that?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I will tell true. Let
            me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,
            and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and fifty each: so
            that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not
            shake snow from off their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> What shall be done to him?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my condition, and what
            credit I have with the duke.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> Well, that’s set down.</p>

        <p><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> ‘You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain be i’ the camp, a Frenchman;
            what his reputation is with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were
            not possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to revolt.’ What say you to this? what do you know of
            it?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter’gatories: demand
            them singly.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> Do you know this Captain Dumain?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I know him: a’ was a botcher’s ’prentice in Paris, from whence he was whipped
            for getting the shrieve’s fool with child — a dumb innocent, that could not say him nay.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his brains are forfeit to
            the next tile that falls.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence’s camp?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> What is his reputation with the duke?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine; and writ to me
            this other day to turn him out o’ the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> Marry, we’ll search.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there, or it is upon a file with
            the duke’s other letters in my tent.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> Here ’tis; here’s a paper: shall I read it to you?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I do not know if it be it or no.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Our interpreter does it well.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> Excellently.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> <span class="stage">[Reads]</span> ‘Dian, the count’s a fool, and full of
            gold,’—</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> That is not the duke’s letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a proper maid
            in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that
            very ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> Nay, I’ll read it first, by your favour.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> My meaning in’t, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid; for I
            knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it
            finds.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Damnable both-sides rogue!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> <span class="stage">[Reads]</span> ‘When he swears oaths, bid him drop
            gold, and take it;<br>
            After he scores, he never pays the score:<br>
            Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;<br>
            He ne’er pays after-debts, take it before;<br>
            And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,<br>
            Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:<br>
            For count of this, the count’s a fool, I know it,<br>
            Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.<br>
            Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,<br>
            Parolles.’</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in’s forehead.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist and the armipotent
            soldier.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now he’s a cat to me.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> I perceive, sir, by the general’s looks, we shall be fain to hang
            you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to die; but that, my offences
            being many, I would repent out the remainder of nature: let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i’ the stocks, or any where, so
            I may live.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> We’ll see what may be done, so you confess freely; therefore, once more
            to this Captain Dumain: you have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour: what is his honesty?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for rapes and ravishments he
            parallels Nessus: he professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking ’em he is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir,
            with such volubility, that you would think truth were a fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be
            swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they know his conditions and
            lay him in straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has every thing that an honest man should not
            have; what an honest man should have, he has nothing.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> I begin to love him for this.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him for me, he’s more and
            more a cat.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> What say you to his expertness in war?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English tragedians; to belie him, I
            will not, and more of his soldiership I know not; except, in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a
            place there called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of this I
            am not certain.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> He hath out-villained villany so far, that the rarity redeems him.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> A pox on him, he’s a cat still.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> His qualities being at this poor price, I need not to ask you if gold
            will corrupt him to revolt.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Sir, for a quart d’ecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the
            inheritance of it; and cut the entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> What’s his brother, the other Captain Dumain?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Why does be ask him of me?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> What’s he?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> E’en a crow o’ the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in
            goodness, but greater a great deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the
            best that is: in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> I’ll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> <span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I’ll no more drumming; a plague of all
            drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count, have I run
            into this danger. Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the general says, you that
            have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can
            serve the world for no honest use; therefore you must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.</p>

        <p class="stage">Unblinding him</p>

        <p>So, look about you: know you any here?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Good morrow, noble captain.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> God bless you, Captain Parolles.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> God save you, noble captain.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu? I am for France.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana in
            behalf of the Count Rousillon? an I were not a very coward, I’ld compel it of you: but fare you well.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exeunt Bertram and Lords</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> You are undone, captain, all but your scarf; that has a knot on’t yet</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Who cannot be crushed with a plot?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Soldier</span> If you could find out a country where but women were that had received so
            much shame, you might begin an impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France too: we shall speak of you
            there.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit with Soldiers</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,<br>
            ’Twould burst at this. Captain I’ll be no more;<br>
            But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft<br>

            been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I

            thou talkest of; serve him still.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire; and the master I
            speak of ever keeps a good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in’s court. I am for
            the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pomp to enter: some that humble themselves may; but
            the many will be too chill and tender, and they’ll be for the flowery way that leads to the broad gate and the great
            fire.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I tell thee so before, because I
            would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well looked to, without any tricks.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> If I put any tricks upon ’em, sir, they shall be jades’ tricks; which are their
            own right by the law of nature.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> A shrewd knave and an unhappy.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> So he is. My lord that’s gone made himself much sport out of him: by his
            authority he remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and, indeed, he has no pace, but runs where
            he will.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> I like him well; ’tis not amiss. And I was about to tell you, since I heard of
            the good lady’s death and that my lord your son was upon his return home, I moved the king my master to speak in the
            behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of them both, his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did first
            propose: his highness hath promised me to do it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son,
            there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> With very much content, my lord; and I wish it happily effected.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as when he numbered
            thirty: he will be here to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom failed.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I die. I have letters that my
            son will be here to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain with me till they meet together.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> You need but plead your honourable privilege.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I thank my God it holds yet.</p>

        <p class="stage">Re-enter Clown</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> O madam, yonder’s my lord your son with a patch of velvet on’s face: whether
            there be a scar under’t or no, the velvet knows; but ’tis a goodly patch of velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two
            pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery of honour; so belike is
            that.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> But it is your carbonadoed face.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk with the young noble
            soldier.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Faith there’s a dozen of ’em, with delicate fine hats and most courteous
            feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exeunt</p>
