        <h4>Scene I. Marseilles. A street.</h4>

        <p class="stage">Enter Helena, Widow, and Diana, with two Attendants</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> But this exceeding posting day and night<br>
            Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it:<br>
            But since you have made the days and nights as one,<br>
            To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,<br>
            Be bold you do so grow in my requital<br>
            As nothing can unroot you. In happy time;</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter a Gentleman</p>

        <p>This man may help me to his majesty’s ear,<br>
            If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Gentleman</span> And you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Gentleman</span> I have been sometimes there.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> I do presume, sir, that you are not fallen<br>
            From the report that goes upon your goodness;<br>
            An therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,<br>
            Which lay nice manners by, I put you to<br>
            The use of your own virtues, for the which<br>
            I shall continue thankful.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Gentleman</span> What’s your will?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> That it will please you<br>
            To give this poor petition to the king,<br>
            And aid me with that store of power you have<br>
            To come into his presence.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Gentleman</span> The king’s not here.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Not here, sir!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Gentleman</span> Not, indeed:<br>
            He hence removed last night and with more haste<br>
            Than is his use.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Widow</span>   Lord, how we lose our pains!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> All’s well that ends well yet,<br>
            Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.<br>
            I do beseech you, whither is he gone?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Gentleman</span> Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;<br>
            Whither I am going.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> I do beseech you, sir,<br>
            Since you are like to see the king before me,<br>
            Commend the paper to his gracious hand,<br>
            Which I presume shall render you no blame<br>
            But rather make you thank your pains for it.<br>
            I will come after you with what good speed<br>
            Our means will make us means.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Gentleman</span> This I’ll do for you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> And you shall find yourself to be well thank’d,<br>
            Whate’er falls more. We must to horse again.<br>

        <h4>Scene II. Rousillon. Before the Count’s palace.</h4>

        <p class="stage">Enter Clown, and Parolles, following</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this letter: I have ere now, sir,
            been better known to you, when I have held familiarity with fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune’s
            mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Truly, fortune’s displeasure is but sluttish, if it smell so strongly as thou
            speakest of: I will henceforth eat no fish of fortune’s buttering. Prithee, allow the wind.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake but by a metaphor.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose; or against any man’s
            metaphor. Prithee, get thee further.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune’s close-stool to give to a
            nobleman! Look, here he comes himself.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Lafeu</p>

        <p>Here is a purr of fortune’s, sir, or of fortune’s cat — but not a musk-cat — that has fallen into the unclean
            fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he says, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use the carp as you may; for he looks
            like a poor, decayed, ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his distress in my similes of comfort and leave him
            to your lordship.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratched.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> And what would you have me to do? ’Tis too late to pare her nails now. Wherein
            have you played the knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and would not have
            knaves thrive long under her? There’s a quart d’ecu for you: let the justices make you and fortune friends: I am for
            other business.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha’t; save your word.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> My name, my good lord, is Parolles.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> You beg more than ‘word,’ then. Cox my passion! give me your hand. How does your
            drum?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> O my good lord, you were the first that found me!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring me
            out.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once both the office of God and
            the devil? One brings thee in grace and the other brings thee out.</p>

        <p class="stage">Trumpets sound</p>

        <p>The king’s coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me; I had talk of you last night: though
            you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat; go to, follow.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I praise God for you.</p>

        <p><span class="stage">Flourish. Enter King, Countess, Lafeu, the two French Lords, with Attendants</span>
        </p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem<br>
            Was made much poorer by it: but your son,<br>
            As mad in folly, lack’d the sense to know<br>
            Her estimation home.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> ’Tis past, my liege;<br>
            And I beseech your majesty to make it<br>
            Natural rebellion, done i’ the blaze of youth;<br>
            When oil and fire, too strong for reason’s force,<br>
            O’erbears it and burns on.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> My honour’d lady,<br>
            I have forgiven and forgotten all;<br>
            Though my revenges were high bent upon him,<br>
            And watch’d the time to shoot.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> This I must say,<br>
            But first I beg my pardon, the young lord<br>
            Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady<br>
            Offence of mighty note; but to himself<br>
            The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife<br>
            Whose beauty did astonish the survey<br>
            Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,<br>
            Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn’d to serve<br>
            Humbly call’d mistress.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Praising what is lost<br>
            Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;<br>
            We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill<br>
            All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;<br>
            The nature of his great offence is dead,<br>
            And deeper than oblivion we do bury<br>
            The incensing relics of it: let him approach,<br>
            A stranger, no offender; and inform him<br>
            So ’tis our will he should.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Gentleman</span> I shall, my liege.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> All that he is hath reference to your highness.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me<br>
            That set him high in fame.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Bertram</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> He looks well on’t.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> I am not a day of season,<br>
            For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail<br>
            In me at once: but to the brightest beams<br>
            Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;<br>
            The time is fair again.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> My high-repented blames,<br>
            Dear sovereign, pardon to me.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> All is whole;<br>
            Not one word more of the consumed time.<br>
            Let’s take the instant by the forward top;<br>
            For we are old, and on our quick’st decrees<br>
            The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time<br>
            Steals ere we can effect them. You remember<br>
            The daughter of this lord?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Admiringly, my liege, at first<br>
            I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart<br>
            Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue<br>
            Where the impression of mine eye infixing,<br>
            Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,<br>
            Which warp’d the line of every other favour;<br>
            Scorn’d a fair colour, or express’d it stolen;<br>
            Extended or contracted all proportions<br>
            To a most hideous object: thence it came<br>
            That she whom all men praised and whom myself,<br>
            Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye<br>
            The dust that did offend it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Well excused:<br>
            That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away<br>
            From the great compt: but love that comes too late,<br>
            Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,<br>
            To the great sender turns a sour offence,<br>
            Crying, ‘That’s good that’s gone.’ Our rash faults<br>
            Make trivial price of serious things we have,<br>
            Not knowing them until we know their grave:<br>
            Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,<br>
            Destroy our friends and after weep their dust<br>
            Our own love waking cries to see what’s done,<br>
            While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.<br>
            Be this sweet Helen’s knell, and now forget her.<br>
            Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:<br>
            The main consents are had; and here we’ll stay<br>
            To see our widower’s second marriage-day.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!<br>
            Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Come on, my son, in whom my house’s name<br>
            Must be digested, give a favour from you<br>
            To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,<br>
            That she may quickly come.</p>

        <p class="stage">Bertram gives a ring</p>

        <p>By my old beard,<br>
            And every hair that’s on’t, Helen, that’s dead,<br>
            Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,<br>
            The last that e’er I took her at court,<br>
            I saw upon her finger.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Hers it was not.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,<br>
            While I was speaking, oft was fasten’d to’t.<br>
            This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,<br>
            I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood<br>
            Necessitied to help, that by this token<br>
            I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave<br>
            her<br>
            Of what should stead her most?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> My gracious sovereign,<br>
            Howe’er it pleases you to take it so,<br>
            The ring was never hers.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Son, on my life,<br>
            I have seen her wear it; and she reckon’d it<br>
            At her life’s rate.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> I am sure I saw her wear it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:<br>
            In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,<br>
            Wrapp’d in a paper, which contain’d the name<br>
            Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought<br>
            I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed<br>
            To mine own fortune and inform’d her fully<br>
            I could not answer in that course of honour<br>
            As she had made the overture, she ceased<br>
            In heavy satisfaction and would never<br>
            Receive the ring again.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Plutus himself,<br>
            That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,<br>
            Hath not in nature’s mystery more science<br>
            Than I have in this ring: ’twas mine, ’twas Helen’s,<br>
            Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know<br>
            That you are well acquainted with yourself,<br>
            Confess ’twas hers, and by what rough enforcement<br>
            You got it from her: she call’d the saints to surety<br>
            That she would never put it from her finger,<br>
            Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,<br>
            Where you have never come, or sent it us<br>
            Upon her great disaster.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> She never saw it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Thou speak’st it falsely, as I love mine honour;<br>
            And makest conjectural fears to come into me<br>
            Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove<br>
            That thou art so inhuman — ’twill not prove so; —<br>
            And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,<br>
            And she is dead; which nothing, but to close<br>
            Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,<br>
            More than to see this ring. Take him away.</p>

        <p class="stage">Guards seize Bertram</p>

        <p>My fore-past proofs, howe’er the matter fall,<br>
            Shall tax my fears of little vanity,<br>
            Having vainly fear’d too little. Away with him!<br>
            We’ll sift this matter further.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> If you shall prove<br>
            This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy<br>
            Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,<br>
            Where yet she never was.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit, guarded</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> I am wrapp’d in dismal thinkings.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter a Gentleman</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Gentleman</span> Gracious sovereign,<br>
            Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:<br>
            Here’s a petition from a Florentine,<br>
            Who hath for four or five removes come short<br>
            To tender it herself. I undertook it,<br>
            Vanquish’d thereto by the fair grace and speech<br>
            Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know<br>
            Is here attending: her business looks in her<br>
            With an importing visage; and she told me,<br>
            In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern<br>
            Your highness with herself.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> <span class="stage">[Reads]</span> Upon his many protestations to marry me when
            his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows are forfeited to me,
            and my honour’s paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to his country for justice:
            grant it me, O king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.<br>
            Diana CAPILET.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this: I’ll none of him.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,<br>
            To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:<br>
            Go speedily and bring again the count.<br>
            I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,<br>
            Was foully snatch’d.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Now, justice on the doers!</p>

        <p class="stage">Re-enter Bertram, guarded</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,<br>
            And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,<br>
            Yet you desire to marry.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Widow and Diana</p>

        <p>What woman’s that?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,<br>
            Derived from the ancient Capilet:<br>
            My suit, as I do understand, you know,<br>
            And therefore know how far I may be pitied.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Widow</span> I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour<br>
            Both suffer under this complaint we bring,<br>
            And both shall cease, without your remedy.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Come hither, count; do you know these women?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> My lord, I neither can nor will deny<br>
            But that I know them: do they charge me further?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> Why do you look so strange upon your wife?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> She’s none of mine, my lord.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> If you shall marry,<br>
            You give away this hand, and that is mine;<br>
            You give away heaven’s vows, and those are mine;<br>
            You give away myself, which is known mine;<br>
            For I by vow am so embodied yours,<br>
            That she which marries you must marry me,<br>
            Either both or none.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are no husband for her.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,<br>
            Whom sometime I have laugh’d with: let your highness<br>
            Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour<br>
            Than for to think that I would sink it here.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend<br>
            Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour<br>
            Than in my thought it lies.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> Good my lord,<br>
            Ask him upon his oath, if he does think<br>
            He had not my virginity.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> What say’st thou to her?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> She’s impudent, my lord,<br>
            And was a common gamester to the camp.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,<br>
            He might have bought me at a common price:<br>
            Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,<br>
            Whose high respect and rich validity<br>
            Did lack a parallel; yet for all that<br>
            He gave it to a commoner o’ the camp,<br>
            If I be one.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span>   He blushes, and ’tis it:<br>
            Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,<br>
            Conferr’d by testament to the sequent issue,<br>
            Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;<br>
            That ring’s a thousand proofs.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Methought you said<br>
            You saw one here in court could witness it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> I did, my lord, but loath am to produce<br>
            So bad an instrument: his name’s Parolles.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> I saw the man to-day, if man he be.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Find him, and bring him hither.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit an Attendant</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> What of him?<br>
            He’s quoted for a most perfidious slave,<br>
            With all the spots o’ the world tax’d and debosh’d;<br>
            Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.<br>
            Am I or that or this for what he’ll utter,<br>
            That will speak any thing?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> She hath that ring of yours.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I think she has: certain it is I liked her,<br>
            And boarded her i’ the wanton way of youth:<br>
            She knew her distance and did angle for me,<br>
            Madding my eagerness with her restraint,<br>
            As all impediments in fancy’s course<br>
            Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,<br>
            Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,<br>
            Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;<br>
            And I had that which any inferior might<br>
            At market-price have bought.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> I must be patient:<br>
            You, that have turn’d off a first so noble wife,<br>
            May justly diet me. I pray you yet;<br>
            Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;<br>
            Send for your ring, I will return it home,<br>
            And give me mine again.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I have it not.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> What ring was yours, I pray you?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> Sir, much like<br>
            The same upon your finger.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> And this was it I gave him, being abed.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> The story then goes false, you threw it him<br>
            Out of a casement.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span>   I have spoke the truth.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Parolles</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.<br>
            Is this the man you speak of?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> Ay, my lord.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,<br>
            Not fearing the displeasure of your master,<br>
            Which on your just proceeding I’ll keep off,<br>
            By him and by this woman here what know you?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> So please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman: tricks he
            hath had in him, which gentlemen have.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> How, I pray you?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> How is that?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> He loved her, sir, and loved her not.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an equivocal companion is this!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I am a poor man, and at your majesty’s command.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> He’s a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> Do you know he promised me marriage?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Faith, I know more than I’ll speak.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them, as I said; but more than
            that, he loved her: for indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what:
            yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed, and of other motions, as promising
            her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married: but thou art
            too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside.<br>
            This ring, you say, was yours?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> Ay, my good lord.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Who lent it you?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span>   It was not lent me neither.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Where did you find it, then?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> I found it not.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> If it were yours by none of all these ways,<br>
            How could you give it him?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> I never gave it him.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> This woman’s an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on at pleasure.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Take her away; I do not like her now;<br>
            To prison with her: and away with him.<br>
            Unless thou tell’st me where thou hadst this ring,<br>
            Thou diest within this hour.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> I’ll never tell you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Take her away.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span>   I’ll put in bail, my liege.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> I think thee now some common customer.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> By Jove, if ever I knew man, ’twas you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> Because he’s guilty, and he is not guilty:<br>
            He knows I am no maid, and he’ll swear to’t;<br>
            I’ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.<br>
            Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;<br>
            I am either maid, or else this old man’s wife.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit Widow</p>

        <p>The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,<br>
            And he shall surety me. But for this lord,<br>
            Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,<br>
            Though yet he never harm’d me, here I quit him:<br>
            He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;<br>
            And at that time he got his wife with child:<br>
            Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:<br>
            So there’s my riddle: one that’s dead is quick:<br>
            And now behold the meaning.</p>

        <p class="stage">Re-enter Widow, with Helena</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Is there no exorcist<br>
            Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?<br>
            Is’t real that I see?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> No, my good lord;<br>
            ’Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,<br>
            The name and not the thing.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Both, both. O, pardon!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> O my good lord, when I was like this maid,<br>
            I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;<br>
            And, look you, here’s your letter; this it says:<br>
            ‘When from my finger you can get this ring<br>
            And are by me with child,’ &amp; c. This is done:<br>
            Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,<br>
            I’ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> If it appear not plain and prove untrue,<br>
            Deadly divorce step between me and you!<br>
            O my dear mother, do I see you living?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:</p>

        <p class="stage">To Parolles</p>

        <p>Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,<br>
            I thank thee: wait on me home, I’ll make sport with thee:<br>
            Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Let us from point to point this story know,<br>
            To make the even truth in pleasure flow.</p>

        <p class="stage">To Diana</p>

        <p>If thou be’st yet a fresh uncropped flower,<br>
            Choose thou thy husband, and I’ll pay thy dower;<br>
            For I can guess that by thy honest aid<br>
            Thou keep’st a wife herself, thyself a maid.<br>
            Of that and all the progress, more or less,<br>
            Resolvedly more leisure shall express:<br>
            All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,<br>
            The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.</p>
