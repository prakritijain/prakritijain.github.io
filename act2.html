        <p><span class="stage">Flourish of cornets. Enter the King, attended with divers young Lords taking leave for the
Florentine war; Bertram, and Parolles</span>
        </p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles<br>
            Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:<br>
            Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all<br>
            The gift doth stretch itself as ’tis received,<br>
            And is enough for both.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> ’Tis our hope, sir,<br>
            After well enter’d soldiers, to return<br>
            And find your grace in health.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart<br>
            Will not confess he owes the malady<br>
            That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;<br>
            Whether I live or die, be you the sons<br>
            Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy —<br>
            Those bated that inherit but the fall<br>
            Of the last monarchy — see that you come<br>
            Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when<br>
            The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,<br>
            That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:<br>
            They say, our French lack language to deny,<br>
            If they demand: beware of being captives,<br>
            Before you serve.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Both</span>   Our hearts receive your warnings.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Farewell. Come hither to me.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit, attended</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> ’Tis not his fault, the spark.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> O, ’tis brave wars!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Most admirable: I have seen those wars.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I am commanded here, and kept a coil with<br>
            ‘Too young’ and ’the next year’ and ’’tis too early.’</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> An thy mind stand to’t, boy, steal away bravely.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,<br>
            Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,<br>
            Till honour be bought up and no sword worn<br>
            But one to dance with! By heaven, I’ll steal away.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> There’s honour in the theft.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Commit it, count.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> I am your accessary; and so, farewell.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> Farewell, captain.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> Sweet Monsieur Parolles!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and lustrous, a word,
            good metals: you shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war,
            here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword entrenched it: say to him, I live; and observe his reports for
            me.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> We shall, noble captain.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exeunt Lords</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Stay: the king.</p>

        <p class="stage">Re-enter King. Bertram and Parolles retire</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> <span class="stage">[To Bertram]</span> Use a more spacious ceremony to the
            noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to them: for they
            wear themselves in the cap of the time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and move under the influence of the most
            received star; and though the devil lead the measure, such are to be followed: after them, and take a more dilated
            farewell.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> And I will do so.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exeunt Bertram and Parolles</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Lafeu</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> <span class="stage">[Kneeling]</span> Pardon, my lord, for me and for my
            tidings.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> I’ll fee thee to stand up.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Then here’s a man stands, that has brought his pardon.<br>
            I would you had kneel’d, my lord, to ask me mercy,<br>
            And that at my bidding you could so stand up.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,<br>
            And ask’d thee mercy for’t.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Good faith, across: but, my good lord ’tis thus;<br>
            Will you be cured of your infirmity?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> No.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?<br>
            Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if<br>
            My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine<br>
            That’s able to breathe life into a stone,<br>
            Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary<br>
            With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,<br>
            Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,<br>
            To give great Charlemain a pen in’s hand,<br>
            And write to her a love-line.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> What ‘her’ is this?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Why, Doctor She: my lord, there’s one arrived,<br>
            If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,<br>
            If seriously I may convey my thoughts<br>
            In this my light deliverance, I have spoke<br>
            With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,<br>
            Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more<br>
            Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her<br>
            For that is her demand, and know her business?<br>
            That done, laugh well at me.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Now, good Lafeu,<br>
            Bring in the admiration; that we with thee<br>
            May spend our wonder too, or take off thine<br>
            By wondering how thou took’st it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Nay, I’ll fit you,<br>
            And not be all day neither.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.</p>

        <p class="stage">Re-enter Lafeu, with Helena</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Nay, come your ways.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> This haste hath wings indeed.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Nay, come your ways:<br>
            This is his majesty; say your mind to him:<br>
            A traitor you do look like; but such traitors<br>
            His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid’s uncle,<br>
            That dare leave two together; fare you well.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Now, fair one, does your business follow us?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Ay, my good lord.<br>
            Gerard de Narbon was my father;<br>
            In what he did profess, well found.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> I knew him.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> The rather will I spare my praises towards him:<br>
            Knowing him is enough. On’s bed of death<br>
            Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.<br>
            Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,<br>
            And of his old experience the oily darling,<br>
            He bade me store up, as a triple eye,<br>
            Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;<br>
            And hearing your high majesty is touch’d<br>
            With that malignant cause wherein the honour<br>
            Of my dear father’s gift stands chief in power,<br>
            I come to tender it and my appliance<br>
            With all bound humbleness.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> We thank you, maiden;<br>
            But may not be so credulous of cure,<br>
            When our most learned doctors leave us and<br>
            The congregated college have concluded<br>
            That labouring art can never ransom nature<br>
            From her inaidible estate; I say we must not<br>
            So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,<br>
            To prostitute our past-cure malady<br>
            To empirics, or to dissever so<br>
            Our great self and our credit, to esteem<br>
            A senseless help when help past sense we deem.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> My duty then shall pay me for my pains:<br>
            I will no more enforce mine office on you.<br>
            Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts<br>
            A modest one, to bear me back a again.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> I cannot give thee less, to be call’d grateful:<br>
            Thou thought’st to help me; and such thanks I give<br>
            As one near death to those that wish him live:<br>
            But what at full I know, thou know’st no part,<br>
            I knowing all my peril, thou no art.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> What I can do can do no hurt to try,<br>
            Since you set up your rest ’gainst remedy.<br>
            He that of greatest works is finisher<br>
            Oft does them by the weakest minister:<br>
            So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,<br>
            When judges have been babes; great floods have flown<br>
            From simple sources, and great seas have dried<br>
            When miracles have by the greatest been denied.<br>
            Oft expectation fails and most oft there<br>
            Where most it promises, and oft it hits<br>
            Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;<br>
            Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:<br>
            Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Inspired merit so by breath is barr’d:<br>
            It is not so with Him that all things knows<br>
            As ’tis with us that square our guess by shows;<br>
            But most it is presumption in us when<br>
            The help of heaven we count the act of men.<br>
            Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;<br>
            Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.<br>
            I am not an impostor that proclaim<br>
            Myself against the level of mine aim;<br>
            But know I think and think I know most sure<br>
            My art is not past power nor you past cure.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Are thou so confident? within what space<br>
            Hopest thou my cure?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> The great’st grace lending grace<br>
            Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring<br>
            Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,<br>
            Ere twice in murk and occidental damp<br>
            Moist Hesperus hath quench’d his sleepy lamp,<br>
            Or four and twenty times the pilot’s glass<br>
            Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,<br>
            What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,<br>
            Health shall live free and sickness freely die.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Upon thy certainty and confidence<br>
            What darest thou venture?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Tax of impudence,<br>
            A strumpet’s boldness, a divulged shame<br>
            Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden’s name<br>
            Sear’d otherwise; nay, worse — if worse — extended<br>
            With vilest torture let my life be ended.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak<br>
            His powerful sound within an organ weak:<br>
            And what impossibility would slay<br>
            In common sense, sense saves another way.<br>
            Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate<br>
            Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,<br>
            Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all<br>
            That happiness and prime can happy call:<br>
            Thou this to hazard needs must intimate<br>
            Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.<br>
            Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,<br>
            That ministers thine own death if I die.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> If I break time, or flinch in property<br>
            Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,<br>
            And well deserved: not helping, death’s my fee;<br>
            But, if I help, what do you promise me?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Make thy demand.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span>   But will you make it even?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand<br>
            What husband in thy power I will command:<br>
            Exempted be from me the arrogance<br>
            To choose from forth the royal blood of France,<br>
            My low and humble name to propagate<br>
            With any branch or image of thy state;<br>
            But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know<br>
            Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Here is my hand; the premises observed,<br>
            Thy will by my performance shall be served:<br>
            So make the choice of thy own time, for I,<br>
            Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.<br>
            More should I question thee, and more I must,<br>
            Though more to know could not be more to trust,<br>
            From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest<br>
            Unquestion’d welcome and undoubted blest.<br>
            Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed<br>
            As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.</p>

        <h4>Scene II. Rousillon. The Count’s palace.</h4>

        <p class="stage">Enter Countess and Clown</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your breeding.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I know my business is but to the
            court.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> To the court! why, what place make you special, when you put off that with
            such contempt? But to the court!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at
            court: he that cannot make a leg, put off’s cap, kiss his hand and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap;
            and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all
            men.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Marry, that’s a bountiful answer that fits all questions.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> It is like a barber’s chair that fits all buttocks, the pin-buttock, the
            quatch-buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Will your answer serve fit to all questions?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French crown for
            your taffeta punk, as Tib’s rush for Tom’s forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the
            nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen to a wrangling knave, as the nun’s lip to the friar’s
            mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it:
            here it is, and all that belongs to’t. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in question, hoping to be the
            wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> O Lord, sir! There’s a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of them.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to’t, I warrant you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> O Lord, sir! spare not me.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Do you cry, ‘O Lord, sir!’ at your whipping, and ‘spare not me?’ Indeed your
            ‘O Lord, sir!’ is very sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound
            to’t.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> I ne’er had worse luck in my life in my ‘O Lord, sir!’ I see things may serve
            long, but not serve ever.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> I play the noble housewife with the time<br>
            To entertain’t so merrily with a fool.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> O Lord, sir! why, there’t serves well again.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,<br>
            And urge her to a present answer back:<br>
            Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:<br>
            This is not much.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Not much commendation to them.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Not much employment for you: you understand me?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Countess</span> Haste you again.</p>

        <h4>Scene III. Paris. The King’s palace.</h4>

        <p class="stage">Enter Bertram, Lafeu, and Parolles</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons, to make modern
            and familiar, things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into
            seeming knowledge, when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Why, ’tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter
            times.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> And so ’tis.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> To be relinquish’d of the artists&nbsp; —</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> So I say.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Both of Galen and Paracelsus.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> So I say.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Of all the learned and authentic fellows&nbsp; —</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Right; so I say.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> That gave him out incurable&nbsp; —</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Why, there ’tis; so say I too.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Not to be helped&nbsp; —</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Right; as ’twere, a man assured of a&nbsp; —</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Uncertain life, and sure death.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Just, you say well; so would I have said.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you shall read it in — what do
            you call there?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> That’s it; I would have said the very same.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Why, your dolphin is not lustier: ’fore me, I speak in respect&nbsp; —</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Nay, ’tis strange, ’tis very strange, that is the brief and the tedious of it;
            and he’s of a most facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the&nbsp; —</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Very hand of heaven.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Ay, so I say.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> In a most weak&nbsp; —</p>

        <p class="stage">pausing</p>

        <p>and debile minister, great power, great transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a further use to be made than
            alone the recovery of the king, as to be&nbsp; —</p>

        <p class="stage">pausing</p>

        <p>generally thankful.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter King, Helena, and Attendants. Lafeu and Parolles retire</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Lustig, as the Dutchman says: I’ll like a maid the better, whilst I have a tooth
            in my head: why, he’s able to lead her a coranto.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> ’Fore God, I think so.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Go, call before me all the lords in court.<br>
            Sit, my preserver, by thy patient’s side;<br>
            And with this healthful hand, whose banish’d sense<br>
            Thou hast repeal’d, a second time receive<br>
            The confirmation of my promised gift,<br>
            Which but attends thy naming.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter three or four Lords</p>

        <p>Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel<br>
            Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,<br>
            O’er whom both sovereign power and father’s voice<br>
            I have to use: thy frank election make;<br>
            Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress<br>
            Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> I’ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,<br>
            My mouth no more were broken than these boys’,<br>
            And writ as little beard.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Peruse them well:<br>
            Not one of those but had a noble father.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Gentlemen,<br>
            Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">All</span> We understand it, and thank heaven for you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,<br>
            That I protest I simply am a maid.<br>
            Please it your majesty, I have done already:<br>
            The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,<br>
            ‘We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,<br>
            Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;<br>
            We’ll ne’er come there again.’</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Make choice; and, see,<br>
            Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,<br>
            And to imperial Love, that god most high,<br>
            Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">First Lord</span> And grant it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span>   Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,<br>
            Before I speak, too threateningly replies:<br>
            Love make your fortunes twenty times above<br>
            Her that so wishes and her humble love!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Second Lord</span> No better, if you please.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> My wish receive,<br>
            Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,<br>
            I’d have them whipped; or I would send them to the<br>
            Turk, to make eunuchs of.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Be not afraid that I your hand should take;<br>
            I’ll never do you wrong for your own sake:<br>
            Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed<br>
            Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> These boys are boys of ice, they’ll none have her: sure, they are bastards to the
            English; the French ne’er got ’em.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> You are too young, too happy, and too good,<br>
            To make yourself a son out of my blood.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Fourth Lord</span> Fair one, I think not so.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> There’s one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk wine: but if thou be’st not an
            ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known thee already.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> <span class="stage">[To Bertram]</span> I dare not say I take you; but I
            give<br>
            Me and my service, ever whilst I live,<br>
            Into your guiding power. This is the man.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she’s thy wife.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,<br>
            In such a business give me leave to use<br>
            The help of mine own eyes.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Know’st thou not, Bertram,<br>
            What she has done for me?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Yes, my good lord;<br>
            But never hope to know why I should marry her.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Thou know’st she has raised me from my sickly bed.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> But follows it, my lord, to bring me down<br>
            Must answer for your raising? I know her well:<br>
            She had her breeding at my father’s charge.<br>
            A poor physician’s daughter my wife! Disdain<br>
            Rather corrupt me ever!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> ’Tis only title thou disdain’st in her, the which<br>
            I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,<br>
            Of colour, weight, and heat, pour’d all together,<br>
            Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off<br>
            In differences so mighty. If she be<br>
            All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,<br>
            A poor physician’s daughter, thou dislikest<br>
            Of virtue for the name: but do not so:<br>
            From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,<br>
            The place is dignified by the doer’s deed:<br>
            Where great additions swell’s, and virtue none,<br>
            It is a dropsied honour. Good alone<br>
            Is good without a name. Vileness is so:<br>
            The property by what it is should go,<br>
            Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;<br>
            In these to nature she’s immediate heir,<br>
            And these breed honour: that is honour’s scorn,<br>
            Which challenges itself as honour’s born<br>
            And is not like the sire: honours thrive,<br>
            When rather from our acts we them derive<br>
            Than our foregoers: the mere word’s a slave<br>
            Debosh’d on every tomb, on every grave<br>
            A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb<br>
            Where dust and damn’d oblivion is the tomb<br>
            Of honour’d bones indeed. What should be said?<br>
            If thou canst like this creature as a maid,<br>
            I can create the rest: virtue and she<br>
            Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I cannot love her, nor will strive to do’t.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Thou wrong’st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> That you are well restored, my lord, I’m glad:<br>
            Let the rest go.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> My honour’s at the stake; which to defeat,<br>
            I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,<br>
            Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;<br>
            That dost in vile misprision shackle up<br>
            My love and her desert; that canst not dream,<br>
            We, poising us in her defective scale,<br>
            Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,<br>
            It is in us to plant thine honour where<br>
            We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:<br>
            Obey our will, which travails in thy good:<br>
            Believe not thy disdain, but presently<br>
            Do thine own fortunes that obedient right<br>
            Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;<br>
            Or I will throw thee from my care for ever<br>
            Into the staggers and the careless lapse<br>
            Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate<br>
            Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,<br>
            Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit<br>
            My fancy to your eyes: when I consider<br>
            What great creation and what dole of honour<br>
            Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late<br>
            Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now<br>
            The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,<br>
            Is as ’twere born so.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Take her by the hand,<br>
            And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise<br>
            A counterpoise, if not to thy estate<br>
            A balance more replete.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I take her hand.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">King</span> Good fortune and the favour of the king<br>
            Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony<br>
            Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,<br>
            And be perform’d to-night: the solemn feast<br>
            Shall more attend upon the coming space,<br>
            Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,<br>
            Thy love’s to me religious; else, does err.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exeunt all but Lafeu and Parolles</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> <span class="stage">[Advancing]</span> Do you hear, monsieur? a word with
            you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Your pleasure, sir?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Recantation! My lord! my master!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Ay; is it not a language I speak?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding. My

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> To any count, to all counts, to what is man.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> To what is count’s man: count’s master is of another style.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot bring thee.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> What I dare too well do, I dare not do.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow; thou didst make
            tolerable vent of thy travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me
            from believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care not: yet art
            thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou’t scarce worth.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee&nbsp; —</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial; which if —
            Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee well: thy casement I need not open, for I
            look through thee. Give me thy hand.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I have not, my lord, deserved it.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not bate thee a scruple.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Well, I shall be wiser.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o’ the contrary. If
            ever thou be’st bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire
            to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal: for doing I
            am past: as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me leave.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me; scurvy, old, filthy,
            scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there is no fettering of authority. I’ll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him
            with any convenience, an he were double and double a lord. I’ll have no more pity of his age than I would of — I’ll
            beat him, an if I could but meet him again.</p>

        <p class="stage">Re-enter Lafeu</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Sirrah, your lord and master’s married; there’s news for you: you have a new
            mistress.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your
            wrongs: he is my good lord: whom I serve above is my master.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Who? God?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Ay, sir.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> The devil it is that’s thy master. Why dost thou garter up thy arms o’ this
            fashion? dost make hose of sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By
            mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I’ld beat thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and every man
            should beat thee: I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate;
            you are a vagabond and no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission
            of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not worth another word, else I’ld call you knave. I leave you.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> O my Parolles, they have married me!<br>
            I’ll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits<br>
            The tread of a man’s foot: to the wars!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> There’s letters from my mother: what the import is, I know not yet.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!<br>
            He wears his honour in a box unseen,<br>
            That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,<br>
            Spending his manly marrow in her arms,<br>
            Which should sustain the bound and high curvet<br>
            Of Mars’s fiery steed. To other regions<br>
            France is a stable; we that dwell in’t jades;<br>
            Therefore, to the war!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> It shall be so: I’ll send her to my house,<br>
            Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,<br>
            And wherefore I am fled; write to the king<br>
            That which I durst not speak; his present gift<br>
            Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,<br>
            Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife<br>
            To the dark house and the detested wife.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.<br>
            I’ll send her straight away: to-morrow<br>
            I’ll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Why, these balls bound; there’s noise in it. ’Tis hard:<br>
            A young man married is a man that’s marr’d:<br>
            Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go:<br>
            The king has done you wrong: but, hush, ’tis so.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> My mother greets me kindly; is she well?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> She is not well; but yet she has her health: she’s very merry; but yet she is not
            well: but thanks be given, she’s very well and wants nothing i’, the world; but yet she is not well.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> If she be very well, what does she ail, that she’s not very well?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Truly, she’s very well indeed, but for two things.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> What two things?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> One, that she’s not in heaven, whither God send her quickly! the other that she’s
            in earth, from whence God send her quickly!</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Parolles</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Bless you, my fortunate lady!</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good fortunes.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on, have them still. O,
            my knave, how does my old lady?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she did as you say.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Why, I say nothing.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man’s tongue shakes out his master’s
            undoing: to say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your title;
            which is within a very little of nothing.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Away! thou’rt a knave.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> You should have said, sir, before a knave thou’rt a knave; that’s, before me
            thou’rt a knave: this had been truth, sir.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you taught to find me? The search, sir,
            was profitable; and much fool may you find in you, even to the world’s pleasure and the increase of laughter.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> A good knave, i’ faith, and well fed.<br>
            Madam, my lord will go away to-night;<br>
            A very serious business calls on him.<br>
            The great prerogative and rite of love,<br>
            Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;<br>
            But puts it off to a compell’d restraint;<br>
            Whose want, and whose delay, is strew’d with sweets,<br>
            Which they distil now in the curbed time,<br>
            To make the coming hour o’erflow with joy<br>
            And pleasure drown the brim.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> What’s his will else?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> That you will take your instant leave o’ the king<br>
            And make this haste as your own good proceeding,<br>
            Strengthen’d with what apology you think<br>
            May make it probable need.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> What more commands he?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> That, having this obtain’d, you presently<br>
            Attend his further pleasure.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> In every thing I wait upon his will.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I shall report it so.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> You have it from his own deliverance.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> And by other warranted testimony.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge and accordingly
            valiant.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> I have then sinned against his experience and transgressed against his valour;
            and my state that way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes: I pray you, make us
            friends; I will pursue the amity.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Parolles</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> <span class="stage">[To Bertram]</span> These things shall be done, sir.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> Pray you, sir, who’s his tailor?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Sir?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, ’s a good workman, a very good tailor.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> <span class="stage">[Aside to Parolles]</span> Is she gone to the king?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> She is.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Will she away to-night?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> As you’ll have her.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,<br>
            Given order for our horses; and to-night,<br>
            When I should take possession of the bride,<br>
            End ere I do begin.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner; but one that lies
            three thirds and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten. God save
            you, captain.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord’s displeasure.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> You have made shift to run into ’t, boots and spurs and all, like him that leaped
            into the custard; and out of it you’ll run again, rather than suffer question for your residence.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Lafeu</span> And shall do so ever, though I took him at ’s prayers. Fare you well, my lord;
            and believe this of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in
            matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur: I have spoken better
            of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> An idle lord. I swear.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I think so.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Why, do you not know him?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Yes, I do know him well, and common speech<br>
            Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.</p>

        <p class="stage">Enter Helena</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,<br>
            Spoke with the king and have procured his leave<br>
            For present parting; only he desires<br>
            Some private speech with you.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I shall obey his will.<br>
            You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,<br>
            Which holds not colour with the time, nor does<br>
            The ministration and required office<br>
            On my particular. Prepared I was not<br>
            For such a business; therefore am I found<br>
            So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you<br>
            That presently you take our way for home;<br>
            And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,<br>
            For my respects are better than they seem<br>
            And my appointments have in them a need<br>
            Greater than shows itself at the first view<br>
            To you that know them not. This to my mother:</p>

        <p class="stage">Giving a letter</p>

        <p>’Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so I leave you to your wisdom.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Sir, I can nothing say,<br>
            But that I am your most obedient servant.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Come, come, no more of that.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> And ever shall<br>
            With true observance seek to eke out that<br>
            Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail’d<br>
            To equal my great fortune.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Let that go:<br>
            My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Pray, sir, your pardon.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Well, what would you say?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,<br>
            Nor dare I say ’tis mine, and yet it is;<br>
            But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal<br>
            What law does vouch mine own.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> What would you have?</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.<br>
            I would not tell you what I would, my lord:<br>
            Faith yes;<br>
            Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Helena</span> I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Bertram</span> Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.</p>

        <p class="stage">Exit Helena</p>

        <p>Go thou toward home; where I will never come<br>
            Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.<br>
            Away, and for our flight.</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Parolles</span> Bravely, coragio!</p>
